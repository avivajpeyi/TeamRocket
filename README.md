## Concept

(Temp) Game description: A white cube with just one side colored (one of 6 colors) rolls around a grid, trying to land on a same-colored tile with that colored side facing down. Once the colored side lands on the same-colored tile, another color appears on another side of the cube, as well as another tile. Repeat for all six sides for a wonderful transformation!
